                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>First week: 03/25/2019 - 03/31/2019
                    The first week was up to par with what I expected. It was a challenge, it was confusing, but boy was it exciting and fun. I was concerned going into this that some things would be way above my head and for moments they have been but I have continued and I think I have some comfortability with some of the concepts but I definitely need more practice. I think I understand for loops and if statements and scope but I want to master these concepts. My biggest struggle at the moment is the JS - Repeat Blocks feature set 4 which is making the board. I have no idea how to alternate the light and dark squares but I am getting help. I also need to learn how to ask for help. I am really excited to be here because it has been a while since I have been excited to do something that isn't a game or something. I do think I found something or more specifically a career that I may love doing but if anything I know that I will enjoy the challenges and the continuous learning that comes with the industry. I am glad that I am taking this time to change careers and invest in myself.

                    Week 2: 04/01/2019 - 04/07/2019
                    The second week felt much different than the first week. The first week was a nice lead in, slow, and fairly easy. The second week slapped me in the face. I felt overwhelmed when starting the memory match project and I am pretty self critical which caused me to feel like maybe I can’t do this. Maybe i’m not smart enough or maybe this wasn’t for me. Then i started asking for help and Dan took some of us into the other conference room and broke down how to approach project or any piece of work. It helped me see that I should not look at the project or task as a whole but break it down into steps and take it one piece at a time. Then the project started coming along and i was asking for help and i feel like I am starting to understand more. I also felt really happy and I really enjoy the challenge and having support and people who care and are invested into our progress and our learning. Oh we also had the knee breaker for loops assessment and I actually got a 6/6! Feeling good and understanding that it’s not about being smart or getting smarter but trying harder, getting more practice, and seeking help.

                    Week 3: 04/08/2019 - 04/14/2019
                    Wow. OOP. Wow.
                    This week was definitely a ramp up from last week and the class did feel as though it accelerated. We went from working on a calculator to learning OOP and working on OOP prototypes. At the beginning of the week I did not think that I would be able to build a calculator or do anything that could do math. But now on this fine Sunday morning I have a basic calculator that can handle decimals, add more than two numbers, and display the buttons clicked. There are definitely many ways the calculator can fail and I can definitely add more to it and I will. I’d like to add Order of Operations and working on the rest of the logic.
                    OOP is definitely a new beast but as we worked on the prototypes it has begun to make a little more sense. At first I thought i was definitely over my head but Dan is right. With practice and perseverance It does begin to make sense. When time permits or more likely when I make time I will go back and try to redo my projects in OOP. Mainly the matching game  and just maybe the calculator. I also had my first whiteboard practice and it was very different. You do forget what you need to do or how to tackle something when people are staring at you.
                    I’ve also noticed that over the last three weeks I have somewhat become the cohort organizer as I am tracking all the videos, examples, and everything for our class while also organizing extra practice sessions or work group sessions. I have never really been an organized person or someone to organize things. I’d always suggest it and have someone take the reigns but here I am.
                    Dan also asked us in class to really think of why we are here. Money is a motivator of mine but what really has been driving me is to get into a career that is challenging and ever changing but also learn something that will allow me to create the ideas that I have and help others. I hope to become a great or the best programer/developer I can be so that I could help others achieve their goals and possibly teach the underserved youths or anyone new skills so that they can improve their lives.
